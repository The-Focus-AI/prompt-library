# Cursor Memories and Preferences

This file stores important memories and preferences that should be remembered across sessions.
It is automatically updated whenever the user says "remember" something.
Update the [memories.mdc](.cursor/rules/memories.mdc) file to store the memories to make sure that you know the rules on every chat.

Its very important that you follow all of the users rules when building new features.

## How to Use

When the user says "remember" something:

1. Add the new memory/preference to the appropriate section
2. Add any relevant context
3. Format it clearly for future reference
4. Update and save the file [memories.mdc](.cursor/rules/memories.mdc)
