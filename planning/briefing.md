description: A prompt to help develop detailed project specifications through iterative questioning

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea.
Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed
specification I can hand off to a developer. Let's do this iteratively and dig into every
relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Once we've come to a good conclusion, or once we are ready to wrap up the brainstorming process,
compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? Include all relevant
requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a
testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.
Put this into memory-bank/projectbrief.md

Once the projectbrief is written, develop an implementation plan and update the memory-bank
