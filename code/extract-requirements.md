Extract all the learnings out of this repository -- ask me what I want to focus on.
Look through all the of code, and the dependacies, how the build is setup, and
how the tools are setup, and write a clear specification for how to create a project
with these qualities in mind.

If there are any lessons learned that are applicable in the future be sure you include them.

Extract all of this into a clean file -- if you are running in cursor save it as reimplementation-guide.md
