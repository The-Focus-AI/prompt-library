Write a commit message based upon the diffs of the code.

Each commit has a type, with a short sentence describing what it is.  There's a longer paragraph afterwards describing the change

feat: Introduces a new feature (correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning). 
fix: Patches a bug (correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning). 
docs: Documentation changes (e.g., updates to README or other markdown files). 
style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.). 
refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature. 
perf: Improves performance. 
test: Adds missing tests or corrects existing tests. 
chore: Changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (e.g., updating dependencies). 
build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies 
ci: Continuous integration related changes 
revert: Reverts a previous commit
