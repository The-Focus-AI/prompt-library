# Visual Metaphor Generator Prompt

To create visual metaphors for your key concept:

1. Identify the core ideas, emotions, or qualities of your concept.
2. Consider how these elements might be represented through visual symbols, environments, objects, or interactions.
3. Create 4-5 detailed visual metaphor descriptions that capture the essence of your concept.
4. Make your descriptions specific, evocative, and detailed enough for Midjourney to interpret.

## Example:

For the concept "Innovation":

1. "A seedling breaking through concrete, its vibrant green leaves unfurling toward sunlight streaming between towering skyscrapers, droplets of water catching the light like tiny prisms, 8k photography, hyperrealistic detail"

2. "A network of glowing neural pathways forming the shape of a lightbulb, suspended in a dark void with particles of light dancing around it, each connection pulsing with energy, cinematic lighting, octane render"

3. "Ancient gears and modern circuit boards seamlessly interlocking in an impossible clockwork mechanism, with small butterflies emerging from the mechanism, dramatic lighting, studio photography"

4. "A door opening in the middle of a vast ocean, revealing a lush otherworldly landscape beyond the threshold, with mathematical equations floating like mist at the boundary, dramatic sunset lighting, photorealistic"
